pixelatize
---
pixelatize allows you to upload an image and "8-bit-ify" or pixelate or pixelize or whatever you want to call it. it's fun, ok.

i also added buttons for "enhance" which animates the pixelation back to pixel, ie. "enhancing" the image like you're some sort of cool detective on law & order or CSI.

"fade" animates the pixelation to super large pixels, making it seem like the image is fizzling way.
